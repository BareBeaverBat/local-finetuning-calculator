# local-finetuning-calculator
final project for OSU CSE6431



a model's json file under model_details should have the exact same name as its model id in huggingface
(and it should be in a subfolder with the same name as that model id's organization name or namespace or w/e)

TODO want/need to revise above constraint/assumption - many models will have a bunch of variants in huggingface with exactly the same architecture/param-counts
